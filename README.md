# LuoConverter-Design-Control-Hardware
This project involves the design, simulation, and hardware implementation of a high-efficiency DC-DC Luo Converter. It includes controller analysis using PID, 2-DOF, and 3-DOF strategies, with simulations in MATLAB and Mathematica, and hardware prototyping via KiCad and PCB etching. Achieved up to 96.15% simulation and 93.08% hardware efficiency.
